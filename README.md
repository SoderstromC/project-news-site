# News Site

My assignment is to create a classic news site that responds to different devices/sizes.


## The problem
Plan & Organisation
I unfortunately feel ill in covid when I was to start the pre-course but due to time constraints I had to get going with it anyway. This however led to a lower ability to concentrate and structure my work ahead, so my plan became to crack on in the periods where I had a bit of energy. Unfortunately one consequence was that I missed reading the last part of of the instructions that was under the figjam sketches, hence didn't see the starter template etc. in github until close to finalising the assignment and spotting it then, so I did instead build from scratch with the helpmof your intro videos and google. I assessed wether to start over using your template but decided to instead continue with the one I had built myself and almost finalised.

Problem
For the basic structure of the news site (non responsive), as well as the "main news" and "sub news" sections I got on pretty well with the help of your videos and google, using VS Code.

The bigger problem I faced was when tackling the navbar responsiveness. I used google to find code for the "hamburger lines" for phone. I found two options, one that was CSS with responsiveness that I had a very hard time understanding the structure of, and one that was without responsiveness and an easier structure to understand. I opted for the easy to read and understand, which in hindsight was a big mistake. What I learned was that it had so many styling elements that adjusting for responsiveness became a real hassle. And I believe my choice led to more time spend and meltdowns than if I would have just put the effort in to try and understand the CSS with responsiveness-one. If I had more time or could do it over again I would have scrapped the code I chose and start over with the responsive one.

If I had more time I would have fine tuned the styling to align the content better. Example being that my news boxes as currently have two of the sub news boxes (box-two) with a very light background whereas the other two have a white backgrouund. I would also move on to the stretch goals and play around with more functionality.
